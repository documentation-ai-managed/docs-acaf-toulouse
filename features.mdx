## Document Organization and Hierarchies

Create structured documentation spaces with folders, pages, and subpages. You nest content logically to reflect your project's architecture, making navigation intuitive.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Space" icon="plus">
    Start a new documentation space for your project.

    ```
    POST https://api.example.com/v1/spaces
    ```

    Include `name` and `description` in the body.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Folders" icon="folder">
    Organize pages into folders.

````javascript
const newFolder = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/folders', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    spaceId: 'space-123',
    name: 'API Reference',
    parentId: null
  })
});
````

  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Pages" icon="file-text">
    Add pages under folders for hierarchy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
Use consistent naming conventions like "API v1.0" for folders to speed up team onboarding.
</Callout>

## Collaboration and Version Control

Team members edit documents in real-time with granular permissions. Track every change with version history, rollbacks, and diff views.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Real-time Editing" icon="edit-3">
    Multiple users modify content simultaneously. Changes appear instantly without page reloads.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Version History" icon="git-branch">
    View and restore previous versions.

    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,cURL">
````javascript
// Fetch version history
const history = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/documents/space-123/history');
const versions = await history.json();
````
````bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/v1/documents/space-123/history
````
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Search and Filtering Tools

Locate any document quickly with full-text search, tags, and filters. Support advanced queries for titles, content, or metadata.

| Filter Type | Description | Example Query |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Full-text   | Searches across all content | `authentication API` |
| Tags        | Filters by user-defined tags | `tag:security` |
| Date Range  | Recent changes only | `created:>2024-01-01` |
| Author      | Content by specific user | `author:john@example.com` |

<Callout kind="info">
Combine filters like `tag:api created:>2024-01-01` for precise results.
</Callout>

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Syntax" default-open="false">
Use operators such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` for complex queries. For example: `API AND (auth OR login) NOT deprecated`.
</Expandable>
